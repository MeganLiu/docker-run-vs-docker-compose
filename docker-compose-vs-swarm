he difference between Docker Swarm and Docker Compose is that Compose is used for configuring multiple containers in the same host.
Docker Swarm is different in that it is a container orchestration tool. 
This means that Docker Swarm lets you connect containers to multiple hosts similar to Kubernetes.
Docker Swarm has two types of services: replicated and global.

Replicated services: Swarm mode replicated services functions based on a specified number of replica tasks for the swarm manager to assign to available nodes.

Global services: Global services function by using the swam manager to schedule one task to each available node that meets the services constraints and resource requirements.
